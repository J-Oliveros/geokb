    "The Geoscience Knowledgebase (GeoKB) needs a representation of rocks, minerals, and commodities (mostly mineral but others as well) as identified entities that can be linked to from other entities in various ways. For instance, we identify mineral commodities in documents like the NI 43-101 Technical Reports as the commodities being mined in a mining project. We link to these entities in various ways through properties in the graph that define the relationship of a subject item to an object rock, mineral, or commodity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works through a process of pulling rocks, minerals, and commodities from Mindat, introducing a small part of their information into the GeoKB to represent those concepts. Mindat gives us the best open online source of minerological information, providing us with things like the best technical interface to IMA-listed minerals and much other useful information. Mindat is currently in the process of engineering and releasing an API that provides a reasonable interface to work against for both an initial representation of some types of items as well as ongoing connections and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the GeoKB, we really only need a small portion of the content that Mindat provides, including linkages on identifiers that will let us re-tap the system as needed for things we don't port into our knowledge graph. We're going to focus on just those pieces we need for query, linkage, and reasoning in the GeoKB, ignoring or only minimally representing everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everything in a name\n",
    "We are currently experimenting with a design decision that may or may not be the best way to go. Certain named entities can mean more than one thing. For instance, the concept \"manganese\" is a chemical element, a metallic mineral (not on the IMA list), and a commodity. Mindat treats each of these as separate unique entities, which is a perfectly reasonable approach given its data structure. As a knowledge representation, we are experimenting with establishing a single unique entity in the GeoKB that is instantiated as a chemical element, mineral, and mineral commodity at the same time. We link the assertion of manganese as a mineral and mineral commodity to Mindat via the specific identifiers in that system along with the additional reference to a commodity code in the USGS MRDS. This gives us a single concept to link to in multiple contexts, relying on the property establishing the linkage to determine what the context is. This may or may not prove out to be the most workable approach, and we'll determine that through usage and adjust as needed."

    "# Mindat API helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Mindat API](https://api.mindat.org) is a REST API built on a Django framework. It is still in beta. There is some documentation on board and a \"learning interface\" where we can explore functionality. It is fine for what it does, but it requires a certain finesse to work through and get out what we need for some particular purpose. It is not specifically designed for the kind of thing I'm doing here or any use case where we are wanting to pull all records within some context and only certain parts of those records for translation into a different representation. Something like GraphQL might be a more flexible framework to think about in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I've done here is put together a couple simple helper functions that handle the basic mechanics of what I'm trying to get done. For one thing, I have to paginate through responses when I'm trying to pull a large set of records like all rocks. There are also coded values that need to be used like \"entrytype\" that I translate to a name for clarity. GraphQL against the full data model would be an improvement in both these cases."

    "# Rocks\n",
    "\n",
    "We do need to have a representation of most or all of what Mindat has in its rock classification. Whether or not we want to represent the full hierarchical classification is a question. The rock type classification for [Garnet clinopyroxenite](https://www.mindat.org/min-470579.html) is an interesting example. The data we get from the API is fully sufficient to create what's shown in the web app. We get to the level of [Coarse-grained-ultramafic-rock](https://www.mindat.org/min-50598.html), and we have the split classification represented in data as rock_parent and rock_parent2. Since we will presumably have all of these items in the GeoKB representation, we may as well go ahead and capture the relationships in claims for the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handful (17) of Mindat's rocks are listed with identifiers from the British Geological Survey's rock classification system. This is one of several efforts to provide a semantically explicit rock type system. It is available in linked data form from the BGS, maintained via [GitHub](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/vocabularies/tree/main/vocabularies) with other vocabularies. Interestingly, the BGS source includes their own take on geochronology that I've not yet compared to the IUGS source I ended up using (see the \"Geo Time\" notebook.) There are also some other representations of rock type/lithology classification schemes in various states of maturity and questionable \"authoritativeness\" that we could explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the question here is, should we start with what Mindat provides on named rocks and build up from there, or should we spend the time tracking down and hashing through other sources that may or may not be more complete or robust for this particular piece of information? This kinds of brings up an overall philosophical question exposed by this type of work and what exactly we should tap into for our own purposes. On one end of the spectrum are platforms like Mindat and our own MRData that are fundamentally a structured blend of data, information, and knowledge initially designed and built exclusively for human consumption. Later they have added in functionality like APIs or encoded renderings of their contents, mainly for human app-builders to write software against to go do other things. On the other end, we have numerous attempts to encode some of that same data, information, and knowledge essentially for AIs to operate against or other reasoning processes that need something more efficient to work at scale (size and complexity) of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a lot of ways, the best next generation frameworks should do both things well. This is where approaches like schema.org and the related \"Science on Schema\" work in ESIP come into play. They take what starts and continues as a web system designed to communicate concepts to humans and embed encoded data, information, and knowledge in a way that AIs can read the same content more efficiently for themselves. This is where I think OpenMindat is going as a project. Unfortunately, we don't yet have a whole lot of those things built out in our domain. They have been built for over a decade now in the world of e-commerce, which is what drove the development to begin with. This is what drives things like CapitalOne Shopping and other AI-driven tools. The more open-ended part of AI that has all the hype right now (ChatGPT, etc.) is just another piece of something that's already been in all our lives, manipulating us to buy stuff, for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm inclined to start with Mindat and then build up from there as needed. It may not provide a fully semantically coherent, AI-enabling API yet, but it does have an API, meaning we don't have to scrape web pages. Most importantly, we can encode identifiers in anything we represent in the GeoKB that are resolvable for both humans and software systems, with the former still the most important. If we link to some name of a rock type and that named entity shows we got it from Mindat and links right to the associated record, then we and everyone else knows exactly what we meant when we established the linkage. It is at least something larger than ourselves and part of a global community system that has active people in our same domain interacting with and improving on the information all the time. As we find things not yet covered in Mindat that we need (about some of the same things or about new things), we can go consult other sources. When we do, we can establish new linkages that enhance what we know and communicate about what we know. "

Wikibaseintegrator is really the most logical abstraction on the Wikibase API I've found, and making a few decisions within the code on where to send pieces of information seems reasonable and effective.\n",
