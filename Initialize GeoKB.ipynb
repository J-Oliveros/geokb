    "This notebook is a work in progress process for initializing the Geoscience Knowledgebase with a set of properties and foundational semantics that establishes a base to build from in curating geoscientific knowledge. Our initial use cases have to do with integrating mineral occurrence information along with document references contributing to those and other facts and concepts associated with conducting mineral resource assessment. In order to build a useful knowledge graph on these concepts, though, we also need to tie in lots of other things needed for the claims associated with these things to legitimately link to other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we use NI \"43-101 Technical Reports\" and a newer \"SK-1300 Technical Report\" as sources for claims associated with mining projects/properties such as geographic location, mineral commodities identified and/or extracted, figures indicating estimates of ore grade and tonnage, and other details. These are technical geoscientific reports required by the Canadian and U.S. governments, respectively. We need an \"instance of\" (rdf:type) claim on everything like this in the system. While we could simply create items in the graph to represent these two classes with no further classification, it is useful to \"work back up the semantic hierarchy\" for as many concepts as we can as far as we need to in order for the information we are recording in the GeoKB to be understandable in the broader global knowledge commons (Wikidata and/or other efforts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization process here is designed to give us a semantic baseline to work from as we pull in the information and connections we really care about within this context. We're taking a pragmatic approach that is slightly more rigorous (and certainly more streamlined) than the wild west of Wikidata but somewhere short of endlessly academic. We have to get a whole bunch of information into the GeoKB to support analytical use, so we make a best effort to align what we have with mature ontologies and namespaces, knowing we'll have to evolve it over time. The notebook approach on this gives us a good basis to record our reasoning and the places we have to make pragmatic tradeoffs."

    "\n",
    "Eventually, we will end up in the same situation that Wikidata is in where we will have multiple items with the same label that are disambiguated by their other attributes (classification being the likely chief distinguishing factor). Key examples on the close horizon will be how we deal with minerals such as gold that can be both a chemical element, as defined in Wikidata now, and a mineral commodity in some contexts. Do we have one item called \"gold\" that can be an instance of a number of things or multiple items with the same label that need to be disambiguated?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the immediate future, I'm going to take the approach of constraining the GeoKB to unique labels (including alt labels) and see where we run into problems. The check_item_label() function is something I'm setting up to be run any time we go to create an item so that we ensure uniqueness.\n",

    "Looking toward the initial use cases for the GeoKB, we need to lay down a basic structure for properties and classification such that the items we need to introduce will all have an appropriate instance of claim pointing to a reasonable concept for basic organization. We could go on forever trying to get the semantics just right and aligned with as many sources of definition as possible, but we'll ease into that level of sophistication over time. In the near term, I've started a Google Sheet to contain the basic structure to get our knowledgebase initialized. We will likely need to iterate on this several times to get it right, and we will doubtless miss some things.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways to spin up these details, but a Google Sheet seems simple enough, it can be edited by multiple people, and we can read it as a CSV and process it here in the notebook.

    "## Baseline Knowledgebase\n",
    "\n",
    "We may or may not be starting from a blank slate Wikibase installation. We know we need to have everything laid out in our Properties and Classification tables, but some of it may already exist. We also need to build claims on these items that use property and item identifiers, so we need to determine exactly what's in the current system. My initial attempt to use the search functionality based on pywikibot and the currently non-functional API failed, so I'm experimenting with a SPARQL approach. This is somewhat handy in that we can leverage the SPARQL query builder to figure out our queries, first with a test against the full Wikidata platform and then our own instance. Those queries can be pulled in here based on how I set up the function to get us a result to work from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building properties and items\n",
    "\n",
    "I left off here after proving that I can at least create items. This last bit was following the [tutorial](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Pywikibot_-_Python_3_Tutorial/Labels) on building and editing items to include more rich provenance (history). I'll come back to build this into functional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "After some reading on this, it looks like deleting pages in a Mediawiki instance can only be done by users with administrative privileges. This is probably a good safeguard for us to leverage, but we need to suss out a usable workflow. There appears to be some type of functionality to mark a page for deletion, presumably with administrator action to concur on the action and execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property creation and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "I can get a list of all properties in the instance, but I can't yet figure out a way to get a list of all items. With a full set of properties, we can figure out what we have that's in baseline set, get rid of anything extraneous, and add anything new. We could do the same with items to a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I'm currently working against a Wikibase instance from the wikibase.cloud folks as we're still getting our own deal fully operational. I'm able to create properties using the barebones new_property() function and the pwb.simple_request method, but I'm seeing weird behavior with the SPARQL query not turning up the new property right away. There seems to be a delay, perhaps in an indexing process. This creates a problem if the process would be to fully verify each new property. I could handle it like I have here with an initial check for missing properties and then simply running through everything, trusting the process. But that's brittle."

Our use case for creating items of all types, whether part of the foundation or otherwise, will often involve simply sending in a label along with optional (but strongly encouraged), description, and aliases. We will also re-run this over time when we have new descriptions and aliases for a given set of things to update these basic elements. For now, we assume all English language values, but we will need to deal with multiple languages relatively soon (e.g., mine names in other languages are common).\n",
