    "This notebook is a work in progress process for initializing the Geoscience Knowledgebase with a set of properties and foundational semantics that establishes a base to build from in curating geoscientific knowledge. Our initial use cases have to do with integrating mineral occurrence information along with document references contributing to those and other facts and concepts associated with conducting mineral resource assessment. In order to build a useful knowledge graph on these concepts, though, we also need to tie in lots of other things needed for the claims associated with these things to legitimately link to other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we use NI \"43-101 Technical Reports\" and a newer \"SK-1300 Technical Report\" as sources for claims associated with mining projects/properties such as geographic location, mineral commodities identified and/or extracted, figures indicating estimates of ore grade and tonnage, and other details. These are technical geoscientific reports required by the Canadian and U.S. governments, respectively. We need an \"instance of\" (rdf:type) claim on everything like this in the system. While we could simply create items in the graph to represent these two classes with no further classification, it is useful to \"work back up the semantic hierarchy\" for as many concepts as we can as far as we need to in order for the information we are recording in the GeoKB to be understandable in the broader global knowledge commons (Wikidata and/or other efforts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization process here is designed to give us a semantic baseline to work from as we pull in the information and connections we really care about within this context. We're taking a pragmatic approach that is slightly more rigorous (and certainly more streamlined) than the wild west of Wikidata but somewhere short of endlessly academic. We have to get a whole bunch of information into the GeoKB to support analytical use, so we make a best effort to align what we have with mature ontologies and namespaces, knowing we'll have to evolve it over time. The notebook approach on this gives us a good basis to record our reasoning and the places we have to make pragmatic tradeoffs."

    "All or most of these functions should be movable to the abstract Wikibase management python package we are designing. That needs to be applicable to the GeoKB but generic enough to apply in other types of domains and circumstances. There are other communities doing similar work such as the wikidataintegrator project in the health sciences. We just found a need to start from the basics of pywikibot and how it operates.\n",

    "\n",
    "Eventually, we will end up in the same situation that Wikidata is in where we will have multiple items with the same label that are disambiguated by their other attributes (classification being the likely chief distinguishing factor). Key examples on the close horizon will be how we deal with minerals such as gold that can be both a chemical element, as defined in Wikidata now, and a mineral commodity in some contexts. Do we have one item called \"gold\" that can be an instance of a number of things or multiple items with the same label that need to be disambiguated?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the immediate future, I'm going to take the approach of constraining the GeoKB to unique labels (including alt labels) and see where we run into problems. The check_item_label() function is something I'm setting up to be run any time we go to create an item so that we ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same dynamic applies with properties as well, though those should be more straightforward as we're striving for clear, unambiguous semantics anyway."

At the moment, the Elasticsearch part of the tech stack is not connecting properly, and some of the dependent API functionality in the pywikibot package is not working. The write operations for properties and items are working fine, and we need to establish a connection to the APISite via pywikibot and the user/password bot config we set up previously.\n",

We may experiment with the more secure OAuth methods down the road once we get the mechanics worked out. The following sets up the connection for later use and tests it for functionality. I'm not sure yet on the significance of the errors I'm seeing."

We also need to build claims on these items that use property and item identifiers, so we need to determine exactly what's in the current system. My initial attempt to use the search functionality based on pywikibot and the currently non-functional API failed, so I'm experimenting with a SPARQL approach. This is somewhat handy in that we can leverage the SPARQL query builder to figure out our queries, first with a test against the full Wikidata platform and then our own instance. Those queries can be pulled in here based on how I set up the function to get us a result to work from.\n",

Our use case for creating items of all types, whether part of the foundation or otherwise, will often involve simply sending in a label along with optional (but strongly encouraged), description, and aliases. We will also re-run this over time when we have new descriptions and aliases for a given set of things to update these basic elements. For now, we assume all English language values, but we will need to deal with multiple languages relatively soon (e.g., mine names in other languages are common).\n",

I also get the same error if I add the claim using the GUI. As soon as I get rid of the claim, I can get() the item just fine. And even through item.get() fails after adding a claim, I can still run a SPARQL query to retrieve the item and a subclass of claim. But since I can't run an item.get() any more, after a claim is on board, that means I can't add any more claims using this method."
